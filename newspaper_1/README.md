### Instructions

This assignment will help you practice laying out a page using semantic HTML tags and the CSS flexbox model.

Take a look at `target.pdf`.  This was a screenshot of our school newspaper
shortly before the COVID pandemic began last March.  I prefer to remember happier times. :-)

* You may not use a prewritten CSS framework.  All CSS must be handwritten.
* Use semantic HTML tags to mark headers and article content.
* Create an external stylesheet and use CSS and flexbox to match the pdf.
* Open [maroon.svg](maroon.svg) for the newspaper banner graphic; [photo.jpg](photo.jpg) contains the picture.
* You are encouraged to learn additional CSS techniques to help you complete the assignment.
* Try to come as close as possible the target example.

Visit [Lorem Ipsum](`https://www.lipsum.com/`) to generate text for the Newspaper article.

**Grading Rubric**

* 7 points: Layout resembles the target
* 3 points: Reasonable choice of typography (use the "system font" technique described in this tutorial: https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/system-font-stack/) and reasonable match of font weights/color schemes
