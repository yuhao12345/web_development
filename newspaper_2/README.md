### Preparation 

1. Copy this entire folder into the top level of your own repository.  Make sure the folder name remains the same.
2. Commit and push to your repository.  Verify that you can see it online.
3. You can continue to commit and push often.
4. When you think you're done, create a file named "GRADE.md" with one line in the file that says "I'm done", a riddle, or an interesting tidbit of computer science trivia. (This is because Git won't push empty files). Then commit and push your changes.
