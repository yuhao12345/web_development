### Preparation ###

1. Copy this entire folder into your own repository.  Make sure the folder name
remains the same.
2. Commit and push to your repository.  Verify that you can see it online.
3. You can continue to commit and push often.  
4. When you think you're done, create a file named "GRADE.md" with one line in the file that says "I'm done", a riddle, or an interesting tidbit of computer science trivia. (This is because Git won't push empty files). Then commit and push your changes. 


### Instructions

This assignment will help you get practice with HTML and some CSS as well.  A little extra HTML/CSS research will be required as indicated in the directions.

Challenge: Create a file named `resume.html` and write enough HTML and CSS to match [resume-target.png](resume-target.png).

Refer to [resume-specifications.png](resume-specifications.png) for exact requirements.  Note that the entire content of the page should be a width of 960px, and that the page should be centered on your screen.

HINT: You will need to research how to specify fonts in CSS, as well as how the `margin` property can be used to center the entire page on the screen. You also may want to research the `float` property to position the image on the page.

**Grading Rubric**

* 4 points: Page matches all layout and typography specifications except for photo placement
* 1 point: Proper photo placement in upper-right corner
