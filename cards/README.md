**10 points**

For easiest viewing of these instructions, you may want to view online with a Markdown previewer.

### Preparation ###

1. Copy this entire folder into the top level of your own repository.  Make sure the folder name remains the same.
2. Commit and push to your repository.  Verify that you can see it online.
3. You can continue to commit and push often.
4. When you think you're done, create a file named "GRADE.md" with one line in the file that says "I'm done", a riddle, or an interesting tidbit of computer science trivia. (This is because Git won't push empty files). Then commit and push your changes.


### Instructions

Challenge: Enhance the page so that when the user clicks the link, a new hand of five random cards appears.

* The `images` subfolder provides all of the card images that you will need.  
* You can choose to write your JS directly in the index.html file or create a separate JS file.
* You may use any HTML/CSS code, including any CSS framework, but you cannot use a JS framework.
* HINT: Note that all of the image filenames follow a specific pattern to make 
it easier for you to programmatically determine the image `src` attribute values.

**Grading Rubric**

* 7 points: Clicking the link generates five new random card images
* 3 points: The five cards are unique, as if they were really dealt from a deck of cards
