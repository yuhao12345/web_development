### Instructions

This assignment will help you practice laying out a page using CSS and the `flexbox` model.

Take a look at [target.pdf](target.pdf).  This is what it should look like on a fairly large screen (laptop or larger), but you'll need to invent a corresponding design when viewed on a small phone.

* You may not use a prewritten CSS framework.  All CSS must be handwritten.
* Create an external stylesheet and use CSS and flexbox to match the pdf.
* You can cut and paste the text content from [restaurant-menu.txt](restaurant-menu.txt).
* The taco illustration is named [taco.png](taco.png).
* Feel free to experiment with different fonts, background colors, border styles, and box shadows. 
* Use semantic html especially to identify the header, main section, and footer. 
* You are encouraged to learn additional CSS techniques to help you complete the assignment.

**Grading Rubric**

* 6 points: Layout resembles the target on laptop / large screens
* 6 points: The page responds to mobile devices by redesigning the layout as needed
* 2 points: Fine details of text alignment, yellow menu background, and white page background.
* 1 point: Reasonable choice of typography (match what's shown or find similar fonts)
